# mapjfx

mapjfx provides a JavaFX region containing a map, allowing to zoom, pan, and use markers.

It uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) as the map technology.
More Information about the project can be found at [the sothawo website](http://www.sothawo.com/projects/mapjfx/).

## building the library

this project is built using mvn. The library jar is created by running `mvn package`

## Java versions and branches

the original version started with JDK8. In November 2018 I started the branch _2.x_ which is set to use Java 11 as the
 main development branch.

Pull requests should be based on _1.x_ for changes/backports in the Java 8 version and to _2.x_ for the current version.

Releases are based on _master_ for the _2.x_ branch ad on _master-1.x_ for the _1.x_ branch.
 
## running the test application

the project contains a test application which is mostly used during development. The application can be started from 
within an IDE by using the `com.sothawo.mapjfx.app.TestAppLauncher` class. To get the logging, the IDE should add the provided dependency to the run classpath.

to run it from the commandline it is first necessary to build the library with all dependencies as a shaded jar and 
the run the test application:

     mvn -P shaded package
     java -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml -jar target/mapjfx.jar

The test application does not contain all the features, to have that, check
 [mapjfx-demo](http://www.sothawo.com/projects/mapjfx-demo/)

*Note:* To use the offline cache with Java 11 and up, it is necessary to add `--add-opens java.base/java.net=com.sothawo.mapjfx` to the java call.
